# README

Private Events is a Ruby on Rails project that helps teach Associations.

[Lesson source can be found here.](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations)

This project uses:

* Ruby on Rails version 5.1.2

** Current notes:

Style away so it's prettier to deal with from the start. Then get your highly unvalidated sign-up in place and then build your Events Controller. Allow for errors to show you the way, and test when you can. Just let it me messy.
